						<h1>Overview</h1>
						<p>The T2 Lighter is probably one of my favourite products designed by German Designer Dieter Rams.For this project, I wanted to explore how the landing page of the T2 Lighter would have looked in the 1970s if they had the internet back then.</p>
						<p>Lighters are one of the most simple tools on this planet right now. They are easy to use and can be found everywhere. We can go in any convenience store and just pick one up and voila you can make fire. Yet, what we take for granted now is probably one of the most innovative products ever created. It allows us to create fire with just a simple motion, whether it be a flick f your thumb or just a push of a button. Creating fire is something that our ancestors struggled with for centuries, but now lighters are able to do this in the blink of an eye.</p>

						<h1>Less But Better</h1>
						<p>In many ways Braun was the Apple of its time. Not in terms of market share, but in terms of how important design was to the company's culture and strategy.If we look at many of the designs of Dieter Rams, we can see similarities between his design choices and Apple’s.</p>
						<p>Braun, like Apple is also known for it’s simple designs. Their design team  placed heavy emphasis on using colours with restraint. Dieter Rams and his team had a strong belief that colour should primarily be used to indicate functionality. For this reason, I chose shades of grey for the primary colours of the site and a red to indicate buttons.</p>

						<h1>Innovative For It's Time</h1>
						<p>The Braun T2 Lighter possessed what was known as a magnetic ignition. Now, the magnetic ignition is not so innovative but, at the time of its release, it was quite profound. It eliminated the need for batteries as the energy to ignite the spark was created from the push of the button for the lighter.</p>
						<p>For this reason, I chose to design the site for the T2 as if I was marketing a high tech device such as a smartphone.</p>

				<div class="paragraph-section">
					<div>
						<h1>Wireframes</h1>
						<p>During the wireframe process, I created several designs. The content for them are the same, but the only difference is the hero. In the end, I chose the design on the right since it aligned more with Braun’s philosophy of colour being used functionally rather than being decorational.</p>
