						<h1>Overview</h1>
						<p>The Polaroid Land SX-70 is one of the most revolutionary products ever created. It was the first instant SLR and it still is a product that captures the hearts and imagination of people today.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<h1>Problem</h1>
						<p>When undertaking this project, I thought it would be interesting to explore how a website for the SX-70 would have looked if the internet had existed during the time of itâ€™s release. I came up with a single page showcasing what the SX-70 offered.</p>

						<h1>Looking Back In Time</h1>
						<p>Polaroid is a timeless company and is known for its instant film cameras. When you think about polaroid or look at its older products and pictures, it brings about a feeling of nostalgia. The pictures are not amazingly clear like photos taken by digital cameras today and are in fact are pretty poor quality by todays standards. When these photos finish developing they also have a orangish tinge to them. But, that is part of the allure to these cameras and their photos.</p>
						<p>Looking at these pictures is almost like looking back in time. The fuzzy images and orange glow gives people the feeling that they are looking at some some fuzzy but warm and happy dream. This is the feeling I wanted to give off with the colour palette.</p>

						<h1>A Friendly Face</h1>
						<p>If we really look at the design of the SX-70, we notice how simple it is. Like the first Macintosh, the SX-70 feels very approachable and somewhat resembles a friendly face. Because of this, I included an image of the face of the camera in the HERO. When the website loads on a computer, only the top half of the camera is visible reminiscent of an innocent child peaking over a wall looking at you. It creates a feeling of curiosity and playfulness.</p>

		<!-- PRIORITIZING -->
		<section>
			<div class="project-container">
				<div class="one paragraph-section">
					<div>
						<h1>Prioritizing Features</h1>
						<p>The SX-70, like other products has a lot of core features. Mentioning each of these features is important to educate users about the capabilities of the camera. But, the order in which each of these features are mentioned is very important when designing a website . For this reason, I purposely placed features in order of importance.</p>
						<p>When deciding on the order of each section, I focused on what made the camera revolutionary. So, everything that pertained to the fact that the camera could develop images without a photo lab was critical. So, as much as the camera itself was revolutionary, so was the film. The patented mixture of chemicals within the film was what made the photos develop by themselves overtime.</p>
