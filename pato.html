					<div>
						<h1>Overview</h1>
						<p>Pato was an earlier name and brand exploration that I did for the app ValueMine. ValueMine is an app for value investors that displays financial data to help users to determine the value of a company.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<h1>Target Market</h1>
						<p>Value investing requires a significant amount of research and data in order to make informed investment decisions. It requires a combination of year-to-date and historical financial information, financial ratios and information from SEC filings (i.e. 10-k) when investing. Most serious value investors already have their own methods for acquiring the information that they need, but these people are not our target market. We are targeting those who we call casual value investors. We define them as people who have full time jobs, but trade on the side. Casual value investors generally have to go to great lengths in order to acquire and organize the information they need to make investments. </p>

		<!-- RESEARCH -->

						<h1>Rubber Ducks</h1>
						<p>When coming up with the name for this brand identity, I started with some research. For Pato, I did several Google searches on value investing and some about the more popular value investing gurus.</p>
						<p>While reading about Warren Buffett, I discovered that at each shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway rubber ducks of Buffett and Charlie Munger were handed out. I was immediately nerd struck because I thought they were so cool, but at the same time I was also intrigued about what the possible meaning behind these rubber ducks could be. It turns out that Warren Buffett likes to compare company stocks in the market to ducks.</p>
						<p>The name Pato means duck in Spanish and is what I settled on after doing quite a bit of research on the different types of ducks as well as translating duck in different languages.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph-section">
					<div>
						<h1>Logo</h1>
						<p>Most people are intimidated by investing and in earlier concepts of the app, we wanted to make it so that it would be easy enough for anyone to use, even beginners. Therefore the brand would have to be both friendly and approachable.</p>
						<p>People generally gravitate to ducks. If you sit in a park with a pond or lake, people often go out of their way to feed them and admire them. This is the feeling I wanted to impart onto the brand.</p>

						<h1>Brand</h1>
						<p>The final design of the logo is a simple symbol of a duck with the name in common letters. The colour blue was chosen because it represents trust. Trust is important for our target market, who rely on accurate data to make investment decisions that can mean the difference between making and losing money.</p>

					<div>
						<h1>Wireframes</h1>
						<p>I have explained the design choices for the final wireframes under the ValueMine project which can be read <a href="valuemine.html"><b>here</b></a>. The only difference is that this design includes a filter. We chose not to add this to the final product because of the amount of work it would take to implement it. Also, as an MVP we deemed this feature as not being essential to the app's core function and was more of a feature which would be nice to have.</p>

		<!-- FILTER -->
		<section class="white-background">
			<div class="project-container">
				<div class="one paragraph-section">
					<div>
						<h1>Uncovering Value</h1>
						<p>As an investor, finding companies that could potentially be undervalued is just as important as the financial data for them. There are thousands of companies and finding undervalued companies can be arduous without the use of filters. The filter is designed to help users look at companies based on industry, different types of financials and finacial ratios.</p>

						<h1>The Website</h1>
						<p>When working on this brand, I also decided to explore how a website would look for it. I designed several wireframes which were all generally the same except for minor differences in the hero.</p>
